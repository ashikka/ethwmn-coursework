## 1inch.exchange

- It is a Decentralized Exchange (Swap tokens with other tokens)
- Different because it's a DeX aggregator i.e aggregates the prices on different exhanges and then grabs the best price and offers it to you. Basically, best price, reduced fees to customer. 
- Was developed by 2 Russian guys because of the issue of flucuations and slippage on other DEX (Uniswap) is too much. 
- Offers 250 different currencies, constantly adding more
- Aim to offer best rates by discovering most effecient swapping routes from leading DEX providers.
- Slippage and liquidity is a big issue 
- The platform sources liquidity from various exchanges and uses smart contract technology to enable the optimization of trades.
